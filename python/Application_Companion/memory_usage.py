class MemoryUsage:
    '''
    Provides the memory usage stats for a specific process.

    NOTE: For now, it provides the following memory cconsumption details
    (in MiB):

    1) Virtual Set Size (VSS)
    2) Residual Set Size (RSS),
    3) Proportional Set Size (PSS), aned
    4) Unique Set Size (USS)

    1) VSS (reported as VSZ from ps) is a total accessible address space for
    a process. Its size also includes memory that may not be in RAM (such as
    although malloc allocates space but has not yet written). VSS is rarely
    used to determine the real  memory usage of a process.

    2) RSS is the total memory that a process actually stores in RAM. But RSS
    can still be misleading because it only represents the  size of all shared
    libraries used by the process. It does not  matter how many processes use
    the shared library, the shared  library is only loaded into memory once.
    Therefore, RSS does  not accurately reflect the memory usage of a single
    process.

    3) PSS is different from RSS in that it uses a shared library
    proportionally. For example, if three processes use a shared library, they
    occupy a total of 30 pages of memory. Then PSS will think that each process
    occupies 10 pages of the shared library. PSS is very useful data, because
    the PSS of all processes in the system are added, it just reflects the
    total memory occupied in the system. When a process is destroyed, the
    portion of the shared library that is occupied by the PSS will be prorated
    again to the remaining processes that use the library. This way PSS can be
    a bit misleading because when a process is destroyed, PSS can't accurately
    represent the memory returned to the overall system.

    4) USS is the private memory occupied by a process. That is, the exclusive
    memory of the process. USS is very useful data because it reflects the true
    marginal cost (incremental cost) of running a particular process. When a
    process is destroyed, the USS is the memory that is actually returned to
    the system. USS is the best observation data when there is a suspicious
    memory leak in the process. [1]

    USS can be obtained by summing Private_Clean and Private_Dir
    (i.e. Private_* entries) for every smaps entry.
